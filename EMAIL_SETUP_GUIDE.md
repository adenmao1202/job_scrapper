### 2. Generate App Password
- Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
- Select app: "Mail"
- Select device: "Other" ‚Üí Type "Job Scraper"
- Copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### 3. Update .env File
```env
ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true
SMTP_USER=luizmao1202@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop
```
*Replace `abcdefghijklmnop` with your actual app password (no spaces)*
